# Multicomp
Evolution of Grant Searle's Multicomp for my MulticompX board.

Commit history starts with Grant Searle's original Multicomp, minus some Quartus II output files.

Then the Multicomp extensions by Rienk Koolstra are layered in, again with Quartus II output files removed.

See [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) for pointers to the original sources.
